![Open Circularity Platform](doc/img/ocp.png)

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation
of an Open Circularity Platform as part of the Onto-DESIDE Horizon Europe project.</br>
We demonstrate the Open Circularity Platform through an [example use case within the Construction domain](./doc/construction-use-case.md).

The setup of the Open Circularity Platform is made reproducible by relying on [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for setting up the network locally
that represents the Solid-based decentralized data sharing platform.

Within the network, we have set up:

- multiple data providers each publishing their data behind a secure access layer using Solid pods,
- a webclient providing a Web UI to execute queries on these Solid pods, and
- a Firefox container providing a means to browse the Solid-based data-sharing platform.
 
During the setup-flow, an administrative user generates and loads all data structured using the Resource Description Framework ([RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/)) into a Solid pod.

During the usage-flow, an end user browses to the emulated Firefox browser (<http://localhost:5800/>)
which provides access to the Solid-based decentralised data-sharing platform.
Within the emulated browser, the user navigates to the Comunica Webclient (<http://webclient>)
which provides a set of predefined queries the user can execute over the Solid pods. 

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Setup scripts
# - Download RML Mapper JAR
# - Setup file structure
# - Compile comunica queries
yarn run setup
# Parse YARRRML Mappings to RML & Execute RML Mappings
yarn run dt:mapping:pipeline
```

Now it is time to create the  [Self-Signed Certificates](#self-signed-certificates) and start the Docker infrastructure!

### Security

To enable HTTPS traffic between every actor within the Docker network,
we generate a public/private keypair and a certificate that is signed by
a local Certificate Authority (CA).

#### Self-Signed Certificates

üöÄ Generate self-signed certificates and fire up the services !

```bash
cd ./scripts/cert
./main.sh # generate certificates
cd ../../
docker compose --profile backend --profile frontend up
```

#### Firefox browser

The certificate of our Certificate Authority (CA) must be added to the Firefox
browser.
To do this,
open up a browser and navigate to the Firefox container at <http://localhost:5800>.

1. Open up the Firefox Certificate Manager as follows:
   1. Click the the "Settings"-button (upper right),
   ![Browser setup (step 1): Settings / Privacy & Security](doc/img/setup-browser-step1.png)
   2. Click the "Privacy & Security"-tab (left),
   3. "View Certificates..." (bottom of the page)
   ![Browser setup: Firefox Certificate Manager](doc/img/setup-browser-step2.png)
  
2. Import the certificate of our CA as follows:
   1. Click on the "Import..."-button to open up the file manager
   2. Navigate to "Desktop" (left panel)
   3. Select `ca.cert` and click the "Open"-button (lower right)
   ![Browser setup: Select `ca.cert`](doc/img/setup-browser-step3.png)
   4. Check "Trust this CA to identify websites" and click "OK"
   ![Browser setup: Trust this CA to identify websites](doc/img/setup-browser-step4.png)

At this point,
the Solid network can be browsed securely over HTTPS.

## Usage

### Query

Browse the network through the Firefox container at <http://localhost:5800>.

To query the Solid pods,
open up a tab within the Firefox browser and navigate to
<https://webclient>.
This Comunica webclient allows you to query both
public and private (if authenticated) data stored within the Solid pods of the
Solid network.
The following screenshot demonstrates queries the `foaf:Agent`s over each actor's Solid pod.
![Query: FOAF Agents](doc/img/query-agents.png)

## Demonstration Scenario

We demonstrate how this Open Circularity Platform copes with multiple existing data sources in different serializations,
and with different actors that have different authorization levels.

> üìΩÔ∏è [Demo][screencast-d4_2]
 
When an actor is not yet authenticated,
only access to publicly shared data can be read.
For example, the actors within the Solid network.

A Manufacturer can *READ* User/Customer data.</br>
When authenticating as a Manufacturer,
like Lindner Group,
one can query the where its tiles are located.

A User can *READ* the *Products* of a *Manufacturer*.</br>
From the perspective of a Building Owner, only product data is readable.
However, it is not possible for a *User* to read *Product Details*.</br>
More specifically, the *Building Owner* is not able to query the product details.

## Testing 

### Exeuction guide

Currently, to run the tests, you need to run: ```./run.sh -d . <alice>-<bob>``` where you need to change <alice> with whoever you want alice to be and <bob> with whoever you want bob to be. This will run all tests with tags that do not have any other alice or bob. Be aware that whatever ```<alice>-<bob>``` gets replaced with must be declared in the [test-subjects.ttl](https://gitlab.ilabt.imec.be/KNoWS/projects/onto-deside/architecture/-/blob/test_env/specification-tests/test-subjects.ttl) file (see further) and an ```<alice>-<bob>.env``` configuration file must be defined in the same folder. 

### Adding tests
The specification-tests documentation provides a tutorial on how to do this, but this can be quite confusing as our usecase strayed of the path [CTH](https://github.com/solid-contrib/conformance-test-harness) is meant for. 

Given the current setup of the project, one should start off with the configuration file, which is called ```application.yaml``` and this name cannot be changed as it is a file which is looked for by the [CTH](https://github.com/solid-contrib/conformance-test-harness). 

This file is essential to understand the whole of the testing. [CTH](https://github.com/solid-contrib/conformance-test-harness) expects [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) resources in lots of places so seeing links everywhere which ultimately refer to local files can be confusing. The mappings object defines a prefix and what it gets mapped to. 

In this example:

```
- prefix: https://gitlab.ilabt.imec.be/KNoWS/projects/onto-deside/architecture
  path: /data
```

The prefix will get replaced by  ```/data``` in every file regarded to testing. ```path``` Doesn't refer to a local path, but to the path in the docker container that gets generated. In this case, ```/data```  will be the [specification-tests](https://gitlab.ilabt.imec.be/KNoWS/projects/onto-deside/architecture/-/tree/test_env/specification-tests) folder. Thus from this point forward you need to replace the prefix accordingly to understand which file you are working with. 

The sources object in this same file list in which files the [CTH](https://github.com/solid-contrib/conformance-test-harness) file should look for tests (note that the prefixes here get replaced and thus we get local files.) These files are manifest files which we will get into later.

Finally, the subjects object states in which file the test subjects are defined. These define subjects which will be tested. In our case this is set to [test-subjects.ttl](https://gitlab.ilabt.imec.be/KNoWS/projects/onto-deside/architecture/-/blob/test_env/specification-tests/test-subjects.ttl).

The subjects file gives a description of the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù that gets tested. The name however is crucial. Whenever we test, say ```css```, [CTH](https://github.com/solid-contrib/conformance-test-harness) will also look for the ```css.env``` file. So these names must match. One cannot work without the other. 

Finally, actually writing tests. 
To write tests we use [Karate](https://www.karatelabs.io/). For this create a ```.feature``` file that describes what you want to test and fire away. For examples you can take a look at tests that are already made and/or 
[specification-tests repo](https://github.com/solid-contrib/specification-tests). When a case is ready, you can add this to the corresponding manifest file. If the test file is not mentioned in one of the manifest files mentioned in the configuration file, the tests will simply be ignored. *Warning* 2 tests cannot have the same ```manifest```, no error will be generated if if 2 manifests have the same name, but one of the 2 tests will be ignored.

As our architecture doesn‚Äôt comply with the [CTH](https://github.com/solid-contrib/conformance-test-harness) expectations we will need to add certain tags to some tests. Say you make a test where ```alice``` is expected to be ```Actor x``` than you need to add a tag ```@alice-actor-x```
