## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation
of an Open Circularity Platform as part of the Onto-DESIDE Horizon Europe project.</br>
We demonstrate the Open Circularity Platform through an [example use case within the Construction domain](./doc/construction-use-case.md).

The setup of the Open Circularity Platform is made reproducible by relying on [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for setting up the network locally
that represents the Solid-based decentralized data sharing platform.

Within the network, we have set up:

- multiple data providers each publishing their data behind a secure access layer using Solid pods,
- a webclient providing a Web UI to execute queries on these Solid pods, and
- a Firefox container providing a means to browse the Solid-based data-sharing platform.
 
During the setup-flow, an administrative user generates and loads all data structured using the Resource Description Framework ([RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/)) into a Solid pod.

During the usage-flow, an end user browses to the emulated Firefox browser (<http://localhost:5800/>)
which provides access to the Solid-based decentralised data-sharing platform.
Within the emulated browser, the user navigates to the Comunica Webclient (<http://webclient>)
which provides a set of predefined queries the user can execute over the Solid pods. 

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Setup scripts
# - Download RML Mapper JAR
# - Setup file structure
# - Compile comunica queries
yarn run setup
# Parse YARRRML Mappings to RML & Execute RML Mappings
yarn run dt:mapping:pipeline
```

Now it is time to create the  [Self-Signed Certificates](#self-signed-certificates) and start the Docker infrastructure!

### Security

To enable HTTPS traffic between every actor within the Docker network,
we generate a public/private keypair and a certificate that is signed by
a local Certificate Authority (CA).

#### Self-Signed Certificates

üöÄ Generate self-signed certificates and fire up the services !

```bash
cd ./scripts/cert
./main.sh # generate certificates
cd ../../
docker compose --profile backend --profile frontend up
```

#### Firefox browser

The certificate of our Certificate Authority (CA) must be added to the Firefox
browser.
To do this,
open up a browser and navigate to the Firefox container at <http://localhost:5800>.

1. Open up the Firefox Certificate Manager as follows:
   1. Click the the "Settings"-button (upper right),
   ![Browser setup (step 1): Settings / Privacy & Security](doc/img/setup-browser-step1.png)
   2. Click the "Privacy & Security"-tab (left),
   3. "View Certificates..." (bottom of the page)
   ![Browser setup: Firefox Certificate Manager](doc/img/setup-browser-step2.png)
  
2. Import the certificate of our CA as follows:
   1. Click on the "Import..."-button to open up the file manager
   2. Navigate to "Desktop" (left panel)
   3. Select `ca.cert` and click the "Open"-button (lower right)
   ![Browser setup: Select `ca.cert`](doc/img/setup-browser-step3.png)
   4. Check "Trust this CA to identify websites" and click "OK"
   ![Browser setup: Trust this CA to identify websites](doc/img/setup-browser-step4.png)

At this point,
the Solid network can be browsed securely over HTTPS.

## Usage

### Query

Browse the network through the Firefox container at <http://localhost:5800>.

To query the Solid pods,
open up a tab within the Firefox browser and navigate to
<https://webclient>.
This Comunica webclient allows you to query both
public and private (if authenticated) data stored within the Solid pods of the
Solid network.
The following screenshot demonstrates queries the `foaf:Agent`s over each actor's Solid pod.
![Query: FOAF Agents](doc/img/query-agents.png)

## Demonstration Scenario

We demonstrate how this Open Circularity Platform copes with multiple existing data sources in different serializations,
and with different actors that have different authorization levels.

> üìΩÔ∏è [Demo][screencast-d4_2]
 
When an actor is not yet authenticated,
only access to publicly shared data can be read.
For example, the actors within the Solid network.
[üìΩÔ∏è [Not authenticated] Query actors within the Solid network](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxKL2O-5JJ3dZ1f01BJPbMRP1egqnx5Sjb)

A Manufacturer can *READ* User/Customer data.</br>
When authenticating as a Manufacturer,
like Lindner Group,
one can query the where its tiles are located.

- [Authenticating as Lindner Group](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxsSfr3KDmiqoZUs5xoSrSxWW6IZotsKIw)
- [[Authenticated as Lindner Group] Query: What are the tiles of Building B0?](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxC3Mawc5yP-2ZTL8gwjs2uhVueoC6kvKR)
- [[Authenticated as Lindner Group] Query: What are the tiles of the building at a specific address?](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx4wWg-6mgz45aUczUXiFEeOyNmP43OXHP)
- [[Authenticated as Lindner Group] Query 1: What are Linder Group's Products? Query 2: What are the product details?](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxtDBtWkJkZbwGElBf0hrZiOcF1drFmxQa)

A User can *READ* the *Products* of a *Manufacturer*.</br>
From the perspective of a Building Owner, only product data is readable.
However, it is not possible for a *User* to read *Product Details*.</br>
More specifically, the *Building Owner* is not able to query the product details.

- [[Authenticated as Building Owner] Query Lindner Group's product details: Not Authorized!](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxlDoAHFJQVidm9s1WWCyHUho1P8_Q7iXH)

The *Admin* actor can *READ* every actor‚Äôs generated data.

## Testing

### Local testing

Make sure that the backend containers are up and running:

```bash
docker compose --profile backend up -d
```

To test scenario's between the administrator and all other actors:

```bash
# Before running tests, bring down any running test container.
docker compose --profile test down -t 0
docker compose --profile test up -d
cd specification-tests && ./run.sh -d . admin-any && cd -
```

To test scenario's between "Lindner Group" and the buidling owners.

```bash
# Before running tests, bring down a running test container, if any.
docker compose --profile test down -t 0
docker compose --profile test up -d 
cd specification-tests && ./run.sh -d . lindner-building && cd -
```

As illustrated by the previous commands,
the command for running tests has the following form:

```bash
./run.sh -d . <basename environment file>
```

For more details, check out the section [Environment Variables](https://github.com/solid-contrib/conformance-test-harness/blob/main/USAGE.md#3-environment-variables) in the CTH Usage docs.

### CTH Testing Environment

The testing environment is configured in
[`specification-tests/config/application.yaml`](./specification-tests/config/application.yaml).</br>
In this file, 3 important settings can be configured:

1. `subjects` - The location of the file describing test subjects.
For example, [`test-subjects.ttl`](./specification-tests/test-subjects.ttl).
2. `sources` - The locations of annotated documents that list the test cases to be run.
3. `mappings` - Maps test cases IRIs to a local file system (there can be multiple mappings).

For more details, check out the section [CTH Configuration](https://github.com/solid-contrib/conformance-test-harness/blob/main/USAGE.md#2-cth-configuration) in the CTH Usage docs.
  
#### Subjects

The files referred to in `subjects` are Turtle files which describes the test subject and its capabilities, primarily using EARL and DOAP vocabularies.</br>
For example,

```turtle
<lindner-building>
  a earl:Software, earl:TestSubject ;
  solid-test:skip "alice-admin", "alice-building" , "http-redirect" .
```

The subjects object in the configuration file states in which file the test subjects are defined. These define subjects which will be tested. In our case this is set to test-subjects.ttl

The subjects file gives a description of the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù that gets tested. The name however is crucial. Whenever we test, e.g. ‚Äúcss‚Äù, CTH will also look for the css.env file. So these names must match.

For more details, check out the section[Test Subject Description](https://github.com/solid-contrib/conformance-test-harness/blob/main/USAGE.md) in the CTH Usage docs.

#### Sources

A source is a path to a manifest file where test cases that need to be tested are defined.
For example,
[`./specification-tests/access-control-scenarios/construction/web-access-control-test-manifest.ttl`](./specification-tests/access-control-scenarios/construction/web-access-control-test-manifest.ttl)

The prefixes defined in the manifest file get replaced by the defined `mappings`,
which will be explained in the following subsection.

##### Mappings

Mappings are used to map the IRIs of test cases to a local file system (there can be multiple mappings).
Mappings should be ordered so the most specific is first.
This allows individual files to be mapped
separately from their containing directories.

> The `path` refers to a path within the CTH Docker container.

An example can be found below,
where the prefix will get replaced by `/data` in every file regarded to testing.

```YAML
mappings:
  - prefix: https://gitlab.ilabt.imec.be/KNoWS/projects/onto-deside/architecture
    path: /data
```
