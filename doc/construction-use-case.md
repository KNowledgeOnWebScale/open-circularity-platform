# Use case: Construction

The use case is as follows:

A building owner owns some buildings.
Floors in a building are covered with floor tiles, delivered by a manufacturer, who uses materials to construct the tiles.
At some time in a buildingâ€™s lifetime, the building owner refurbishes a building and wants to decide on what to do with the floor tiles, based on economic and environmental costs.

## Implementation

We map the source data to Linked Data using the YARRRML parser and the RMLMapper.
As a result, every actor's source data will be transformed to RDF, serialized as Turtle.

Every actors has their a pod, hosted by their own Solid server.
Each pod contains the Turtle files of the actor owning the pod.</br>
To operate on the Solid pods (e.g. specifying access control),
we use of Bashlib: a Command-Line Interface to interact with actors in a Solid.</br>
To query the distributed data, we use the Comunica Webclient:
a jQuery widget to query heterogeneous interfaces using Comunica SPARQL.
